**Objective**:

There is a class of computer vision problems dedicated to image-to-image translations where the goal is to learn a mapping between an input image and output image using aligned image pairs. The difficulty with this, however, is that paired training data is not always available. CycleGAN serves as a method to handle this objective while keeping this limitation in mind. We attempt to adopt this approach into the task of translating anime faces onto female selfie images to effectively convert the selfie into an anime character.
